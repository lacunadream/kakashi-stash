// Lifetime rules (Elision)

// Each elided lifetime in a functionâ€™s arguments becomes a distinct lifetime parameter.
// If there is exactly one input lifetime, elided or not, that lifetime is assigned to all elided lifetimes in the return values of that function.
// If there are multiple input lifetimes, but one of them is &self or &mut self, the lifetime of self is assigned to all elided output lifetimes.
